1.5.4. Hot Potatoes
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Hot Potatoes is a Java application that allows for test generation with user defined questions. Because it is a Java application, it can be used on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine, making it multi-platform. It supports integration with many types of tests and the combination of different test types in one html document.
<p>
Overall, Hot Potatoes provides a standard level of testing functionality. It does not support automated test generation, since there is no question bank.
