<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Determine question priority
<p>
This task was accomplished with no hassle. Questions we already had were ordered by priority by the group collaboratively.
<p> <li>
Talk to the customer
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
Test tool generate class results and be downloaded by teacher?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Depends on type of test - some would require grading. If all multiple choice, it would be an option, like send it in an email. At least review from within the application.
<p><li>
Subject field?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Professor defines subjects and assigns them to questions.
<p><li>
Support having multiple users answering the same test?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone looks at one computer, put in their usernames and it gets graded all together.
<p><li>
Save the tests / how long make them available?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Don't worry about it. Professor will manage question bank.
<p><li>
Workflow for creating test?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having different types of generation (basic, advanced, etc). Make a question bank. Professor will go into the question bank and choose options (how long, which class, level of difficulty, time for whole test, keywords). You can also have it say 40% level 5, 20% long answer, 10% short answer, etc. How good the test generator is (correct average rating, time, etc). Smart about the ordering of a test (start with MC, short answer, long, etc in order). Options for how the test is going to be laid out.
<p><li>
Time limits for specific questions?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Implementation could be beneficial, but not essential.
<p><li>
Immediate feedback when completing practice tests?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yep. As long as none of the questions require grading. If it does, we can use something like: "You got 10/12 on MC, rest of grade is pending instructor review."
<p><li>
Test display multiple questions at a time vs single questions each page?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Layout is up to you. We can do single questions with pagination support, progress bar at the end.
<p><li>
TIP: UI design layout.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Get going on design and show to customer (ask if they like or not)?
<p><li>
Results page for student.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instructor sees open tests and progress that students have with it. Results page for what the student has taken.
<p><li>
Reports for tests.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click on name of the test, have windows open that show strengths, weaknesses.
</ul>
<p><li>
