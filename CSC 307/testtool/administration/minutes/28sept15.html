Talk to the customer (again)

<p><li>
Thoughts on imported exernal images and links to the questions?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That would be good. Emmbed outside editor and generate html and toggle mode to tml and xml and incorporate it to the code. May be a difficult feature to include.  
<p><li>
Should we have a question database separated by quarter?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yep. Maybe even filter be field.
<p><li>
TIP: Use Scenebuilder!
</ul>
<p><li>
Assign work to groupmembers for Milestone 2
<p>
We'll be waiting till Wednesday to figure that out, since some members were working on their reviews.
