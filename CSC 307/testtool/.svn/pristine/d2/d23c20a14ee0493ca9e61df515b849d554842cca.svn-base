After the adding a question and choosing the desired type (as covered in 
<a href="question-management.html">Section 2.3</a>), the screen will change accordingly 
depending on the chosen question type.

<p> 
This section covers Coding Questions. Coding Questions cannot be auto-graded
and must be given a score in the the <tt>Teacher</tt> page.

<p>
<tt>Points</tt>, <tt>Subject</tt>, and <tt>Difficulty</tt> are discussed
in <a href="question-management.html">Section 2.3</a>.

<p>
In a Coding Question, <tt>Question</tt> still acquires information
the same way, but the box for displaying the input is larger to allow for longer
questions and any necessary information needed to elaborate on the question.

<p><tt>Flags</tt> is a special section found only in a Coding type question. The user input
words separated by a semicolon. Answers that contain words found in the <tt>Flag</tt> section are 
flagged during the grading section.

<p>
A completed Coding Question is shown in Figure 3-16.
