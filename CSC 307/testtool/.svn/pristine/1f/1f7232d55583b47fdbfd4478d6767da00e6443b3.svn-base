		<p>This document defines requirements for a Test Tool. The tool aids teachers in creating tests, as well as contains a test bank 
      where teachers can store questions from previous exams for later use. Teachers can choose from a  variety of questions, including, but not limited to,
      multiple choice, true false, free response, and coding questions. The tool will provide test results in an organized manner for teachers.
      </p>      
      <p>And for students, the tool will display the tests in a simple and easy to understand manner to allow students to focus and do their best on the exams.
