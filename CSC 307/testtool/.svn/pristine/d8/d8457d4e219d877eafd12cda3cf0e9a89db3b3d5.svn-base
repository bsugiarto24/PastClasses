2.1.  User Interface Overview

</a>
<p>
When the user initially invokes the Test Tool, the screen appears as shown
in Figure 1.

The initial display consists of three buttons: Create New Test, Generate Test, 
and Load previous test. Each button takes you to the same questionnaire-style page,
but Generate Test and Load Previous Test will first prompt instructions for test generation
and then fill in the editor accordingly, while Create New Test will have the page be blank.
The slider on the right slide opens up a tab of menus to the other available sections as 
shown in Figure 2.
<p>
Figure 2 shows the tab open.

<p> The Menu tab can be hidden again by clicking on the protruding tab.
The current section that the user is in is highlighted in yellow.

<p>
The <tt>Editor</tt> section is where users create tests. The layout is similar to that of
a questionnaire, with different spaces to fill in all the question information needed for 
customization.
<p>
The <tt>Test Bank</tt> section contains the lists of questions stored, as well as previously created
tests. The questions can be searched for by a range of categories, such as difficulty, subject, 
and date created.
<p>
The <tt>Teacher</tt> section contains the teacher functions for tests. These functions include adding 
and deleting users allowed to take the tests, grading non-automated-grader questions, publishing grades, 
viewing student information, and toggling on/off whether a test is still active.
<p>
The <tt>Statistics</tt> section is where test information is held. This information includes test averages, 
individual student scores, students' number of attempts, and which questions they missed.
