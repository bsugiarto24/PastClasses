<p>

<p>
The user clicks the green plus button to a new question, and the blue/yellow folder 
button to load a question from the question bank. 


<p>
When the user adds a new question using the green button, the system prompts the user 
for the type of question they want, as shown in Figure 3-2. Each question will have a red minus
button that deletes the question.

<p>
Once the user chooses a question type, the system will adjust the screen accordingly to 
display the different sections needed to create a question of that type. These different 
question types are shown in this section's subsections.

<p>
The common sections found across multiple question types are <tt>Question</tt>, <tt>Points</tt>, 
<tt>Subject</tt>, and <tt>Difficulty</tt>.

<p> 
<tt>Question</tt> and <tt>Points</tt> require the user to type in information using the keyboard.
<br>*note* The <tt>Points</tt> section only accepts numbers.

<p> 
<tt>Subject</tt> and <tt>Difficulty</tt> acquire info through drop-down menus similar to the 
<tt>Type</tt> section. <tt>Subject</tt> is chosen from a list of subjects that the user creates;
<tt>Difficulty</tt> is chosen from a list ranging from 1 - 10.
