in <a href="question-management.html">Section 2.3</a>.

<p>
In a Free-Response Question, <tt>Question</tt> still acquires information
the same way, but the box for displaying the input is larger to allow for longer
questions and any necessary information needed to elaborate on the question.

<p><tt>Flags</tt> is a special section found in and Free-Response and Coding type questions. The user input
words separated by a semicolon. Answers that contain words found in the <tt>Flag</tt> section are 
flagged during the grading section.
