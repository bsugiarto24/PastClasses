            <li>Students</li>
            <li>Teacher Assistants</li>
         </ul>
      <li>Customers</li> 
      <li>Software Development Team</li>  
   </ul>

   <p>The end users are those who use the Test Tool for its intended purpose. 
      Teachers are going to use to the tool to create tests, administer them, 
      receive automated grades, and edit grades if necessary. Students will use 
      the program to take tests given to them. Teacher assistants have the 
      power to administer tests and maybe be able to see and edit grades. </p>

   <p>The primary customer for this software is Oliver Sean and Gene Fisher. 
      Gene Fisher is customer representative for his faculty and staff 
      colleagues in the Computer Science department at the California 
      Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. In this representative 
      capacity, Fisher will consult with other potential customers to gather 
      requirements from them, and integrate their requirements with his own.</p>

   <p>
The software engineering team is composed of the primary developers for this 
program and will be involved from design to implementation of the Test tool.
